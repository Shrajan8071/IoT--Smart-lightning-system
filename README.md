 IoT Energy-Saving System with Presence Detection


 Description:
Implemented an IoT energy-saving solution utilizing a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, relay, ESP32 microcontroller, and ThingSpeak platform. The system efficiently manages lighting by activating the light only when human presence is detected by the PIR sensor, thus optimizing electricity consumption. Data collected by the device is uploaded to ThingSpeak, facilitating remote monitoring and analysis. Leveraged fetched data for additional functionalities such as manual switching, enhancing user control and flexibility.
